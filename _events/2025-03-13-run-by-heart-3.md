Run By Heart was the charity running event where participants can run from anywhere. They could choose a category, track their run using Strava, and receive a finisher medal upon completion. This project was created to raise funds for charity and to promote healthcare through running. We believe that this event will also play a role in building the mindset of unity and social contribution. We raised funds 12,000 USD in total and donated to three organization including:

- Manna4Life School
- The Rabbit School Organization
- Safe Haven
