Run with Sai for 400,000 steps in 9 Days was a project from SAI which believes as an individual we can make a better society. Initially, an enthusiastic runner SAI to celebrate his 32nd birthday and give back to the community by running together from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap to raise funds for Angkor Hospital for Children and raise awareness about social issues. The meaning of Fundraising is not just money, but it is about the critical message and goal that Sai wants to point out to help our children in the future. According to UNICEF, in 2018, the under-five mortality rate was 28 dead within 1,000 live births. We believe that with a little action, we can contribute to reducing the mortality rate and helping other children in need of healthcare. Children are key indicators of the country’s future.

"It just needs one person to start and get support from everyone with the same aim for a good cause." - SAI.
